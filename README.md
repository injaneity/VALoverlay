# VALOVERLAY
An overlay that uses OpenCV to identify on-screen characters, stats and other important data. Created with the intention to perform as an open source alternative to Riot Games' VCT spectator overlay.

### Current Functionality
Able to process the screen in realtime, and identify characters on the scoreboard.
Works in 1920x1080 resolution, writing data to a JSON file.

### More
Left unfinished as of February 2023. Project may be revisited at a later date.
